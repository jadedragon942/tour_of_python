Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data and behavior together.

Key concepts:

- Classes define object properties and methods
- Objects are instances of classes
- `__init__` is the constructor method
- `self` refers to the current instance
- Methods are functions that belong to a class
- Attributes are variables that belong to a class

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
