Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They're perfect for:

- Removing duplicates from a sequence
- Testing membership
- Performing mathematical set operations

Key features:

- Created using curly braces `{}` or `set()`
- No duplicate elements
- Elements must be immutable
- No indexing (unordered)

Common operations:

- Union (`|` or `union()`)
- Intersection (`&` or `intersection()`)
- Difference (`-` or `difference()`)
- Add items with `add()`
- Remove items with `remove()` or `discard()`
