Error handling helps your program deal with unexpected situations gracefully.

Key concepts:
- `try`: Block of code that might raise an exception
- `except`: Handles specific exceptions
- `else`: Runs if no exception occurs
- `finally`: Always runs, regardless of exceptions
- Multiple `except` blocks can handle different errors

Common exceptions:
- `ValueError`
- `TypeError`
- `IndexError`
- `KeyError`
- `FileNotFoundError`
