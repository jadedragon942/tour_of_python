In object-oriented programming languages like Python, an object is an entity
that contains data along with associated metadata and/or functionality. In
Python everything is an object, which means every entity has some metadata
(called attributes) and associated functionality (called methods). These
attributes and methods are accessed via the dot syntax.

In this example, we see that lists have an append method, which adds an item
to the list, and is accessed via the dot (".") syntax.
