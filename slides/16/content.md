Generators are functions that generate a sequence of values over time, rather than computing them all at once.

Benefits:
* Memory efficient
* Lazy evaluation
* Perfect for large datasets
* Can be infinite
* Uses `yield` keyword

Key concepts:
* Generator functions use `yield`
* Generator expressions use `()`
* Can be used in for loops
* Support `next()` function
* Have `send()` method
