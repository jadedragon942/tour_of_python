Decorators are functions that modify other functions. They allow you to add functionality to existing functions without changing their source code.

Key concepts:
* Functions are first-class objects
* Decorators "wrap" other functions
* Use `@decorator_name` syntax
* Can take arguments
* Can be stacked

Common uses:
* Logging
* Timing functions
* Access control
* Caching
* Input validation
