Welcome to a tour of the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language.

Throughout the tour you will find a series of slides and exercises for you to complete.

You can navigate through them using

"previous" or PageUp to go to the previous page,
"next" or PageDown to go to the next page.
The tour is interactive. Click the Run button now (or press Shift + Enter) to compile and run the program on a remote server. The result is displayed below the code.

These example programs demonstrate different aspects of Python. The programs in the tour are meant to be starting points for your own experimentation.

Edit the program and run it again.

When you're ready to move on, click the right arrow below or type the PageDown key.
