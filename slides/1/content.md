Welcome to this guided exploration of the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language.

Along the way, you’ll find a series of slides and hands-on exercises. You can move between them by selecting “previous” or pressing PageUp to go back, and “next” or PageDown to go forward.

This tour is fully interactive. To compile and run the code on a remote server, click the “Run” button or press Shift + Enter. The output will appear beneath the code.

These sample programs highlight various features of Python and serve as starting points for your own experimentation.

When you’re ready to continue, click the right arrow below or press PageDown.
